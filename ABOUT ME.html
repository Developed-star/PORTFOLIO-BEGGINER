           <p> I am an Information Technology student with a strong passion for learning 
            and applying technology to solve practical problems. <br>My journey in IT began with curiosity 
            about how computers, software, and networks function, and this curiosity
             has grown into a focused commitment to developing technical skills and professional competence.</p>

<p>As a student, I have been exposed to various areas of Information Technology, including
 programming, database systems, computer networking,<br> and web development. 
 These areas have helped me understand how modern digital systems are designed, implemented,
  and managed. <br>I enjoy learning both theoretical concepts and practical skills, as I believe a strong 
  foundation in both is essential for success in the IT field.</p>

<p>Programming is one of my key interests, especially using languages such as C and Java. 
Through practice and assignments, <br>I have developed logical thinking and problem-solving abilities,
 which are essential for writing efficient and maintainable code.<br> In addition, I have experience working 
 with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and accessible web interfaces.</p>

<p>I also have an interest in database implementation and management, particularly using MySQL.
 Understanding how data is stored,<br> retrieved, and secured has helped me appreciate 
 the importance of structured systems and data integrity. Furthermore, my knowledge of computer
  networking fundamentals allows me to understand how systems communicate and share resources.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I value discipline, consistency, and continuous learning. 
I believe technology evolves rapidly,<br> and an IT professional must be adaptable and willing
 to learn new tools and methodologies. My goal is to grow into a skilled IT professional who can 
 contribute meaningful solutions to organizations and communities through technology.</p>
