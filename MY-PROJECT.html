          <p>The projects presented in this portfolio represent my academic work, personal practice, and continuous 
          learning in the field of Information Technology.
           Each project reflects my effort to <br>apply theoretical knowledge into practical 
           solutions while improving my technical and analytical skills.</p>

<p>Most of my projects focus on web development, <br>programming, and database-related tasks.
 Using HTML and CSS, I have created responsive web pages that adapt to different screen 
 sizes and devices. JavaScript has enabled me to add interactivity and improve user experience by handling user inputs and dynamic content.</p>

<p>In programming, I have worked on beginner to <br>intermediate-level projects 
using C and Java. These projects include basic applications that demonstrate the use
 of variables, control structures, functions, input validation, and logical operations. 
 Through these projects, I have gained confidence in writing structured code and debugging errors effectively.</p>

<p>I have also worked with databases using MySQL, <br>where I designed tables,
 wrote SQL queries, and managed data efficiently. These projects helped me understand 
 database relationships, normalization, and data consistency, which are critical aspects of modern software systems.</p>

<p>Each project has contributed to my growth by teaching <br>me how to analyze requirements, plan solutions, and implement them step 
by step. I view my projects not only as finished products but also as learning milestones that show my progress and dedication.</p>

<p>As I continue learning, I plan to develop more <br>advanced projects that integrate programming, 
databases, and networking concepts. These future projects will further strengthen my skills and prepare me
 for real-world IT environments.</p>
